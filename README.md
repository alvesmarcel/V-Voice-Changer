# V Voice Changer

V Voice Changer is an iOS app that lets the user record an audio snippet, apply effects to it, and share the processed mp4 file.

## Objective

The purpose of developing this app was to achieve three goals:

* Create new voice effects that I couldn't find in any other voice changer app, namely "Ruler of the Other World" and "Game Master" voice effects;
* Test the [Lottie library](https://airbnb.design/lottie/), created by Airbnb, to perform iOS animations;
* Improve the code architecture of the Udacity's Pitch Perfect project, without adding much complexity, for educational purposes.

## Technologies used

* MVC pattern
* Lottie library
* AVFoundation framework
* UIKit framework
* Auto Layout
* Xcode 10.2
* Swift 5
* Git
